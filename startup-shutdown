# Are you working for a start up or a shut down? How to tell if your business is about to blow up or be blown up. 

> "This is no start up... it's a shut down!"

It made me laugh when I first heard it. My friend and colleague would go on to repeat it regularly, mainly out of frustration. I had started working at a long established business that had recently been purchased by private equity, and they were rebranding as a 'start up'. With the promise of changing the world, I encouraged my colleague to join me.

Depending on who you ask, between 75% and 90% of startups will fail. As a designer, I find this statistic highly disturbing. Moreso when I consider my experience with businesses who are (or want to be) a startup. 

My experience rocked me pretty hard. Less because of the illusions of being a start up, and more because of how little we collectively tried to listened to customers. How hamstrung we were in our responses to their needs. How clumsily we tried to merge competing ideologies.

From a post-mortem of 101 startups (http://fortune.com/2014/09/25/why-startups-fail-according-to-their-founders/), almost half (42%) were due to "No Market Need" - or in other words, a solution with no problem to solve.

How do you get advanced warning you're working for a shut down rather than a start up - and what you can you do about it?

## You're working at a Shut Down if...
### It's an established businesses calling themselves start ups



### There is no true understanding of your customer's needs



### Good people leave because they make no difference



### Your purpose poorly translates to action



### ROI is prioritised over solving the problem



### Vision is lacking



### Consulting theories trump real data





## Your options when working at a Shut Down
### If you truly believe in it, stay!



### Accept it. Embrace it. Let part of your heart die.



### Be an agent for change from the inside.



### Blaze of glory.



### Use the situation for all its worth and move on.



### Review your career motivations and needs

It was funny because it felt true. But it was clear
